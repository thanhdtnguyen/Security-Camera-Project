# Security Camera Project

In this project, I built a security camera app with capabilities of detecting movements, sounding alert, and capturing images.

### Main functions:
1. Detect motions with Open CV.
2. Alert with Pygame sound (for MacOS).
3. Capture images of the suspect with Open CV and datetime.

### To-do:
1. Send notifications to the property's owner.
2. Turn on the lights.
3. Add alert effect when running on Windows.
